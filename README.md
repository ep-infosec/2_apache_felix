# Apache Felix main repository (obsolete)

This repository used to contain the Apache Felix git mirror. With the migration to Git
the content is out of date and should not be relied upon.

This old repository is still kept as an index to the current git repositories. The last (now stale) state before the migration can be found in the archived branch.

Note that all git repositories have been migrated with history, so there should be no reason to clone this repository.

Please do not open pull requests, they will be ignored.
